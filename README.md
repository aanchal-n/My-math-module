# My-math-module
It is a math module that calculates various geometrical values such as area, perimeter, volume etc based on the users input
It is currently designed to compute circumference/perimeter and area for a circle,square,rectangle and square. 
It can also compute volume and surface area for a sphere, cube, cuboid, cylinde, cone and pyramid. 
For now, it's a terminal run program. 
I will be adding gui to it if I decide to work on it further. 
This was developed as a part of my project for a university course. 
It was developed individually.
